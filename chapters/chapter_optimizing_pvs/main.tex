\chapter{Optimizing Photovoltaics}\label{chapter:optimizing_pvs}

In this chapter, \textbf{Optimizing Photovoltaics}, we use the models generated
from the previous chapter to generate potential solar array designs for the
solar vehicle. Along the way, we propose various statistical methods and
algorithms such as hierarchy clustering and compatibility matching to pick cells
for module assembly. This allows us to develop heuristics to minimize mismatch
effects discussed in \autoref{sec:modeling_solar_modules}. We also run
cost-benefit analyses of module sizes versus bypass diodes types to determine
the ideal module size for specific areas of the solar vehicle, which may
experience various amounts of shading over time. Finally, we propose two array
designs: one with these optimizations and one without (based off of our
historical processes), and attempt to estimate the cost and efficiency savings
attributable to each optimization.
