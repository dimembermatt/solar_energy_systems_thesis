\section{Modeling Solar Arrays}\label{sec:modeling_solar_arrays}

Finally, we take the solar module model developed in the previous section and
combine it with many other modules in series to form a solar array model. In
this section we will focus on the global \ac{I-V} curve generated from the solar
array, and how the overall properties of the curve change under differing
environmental conditions, namely irradiance changes and partial shading. We'll
also look at the temporal properties of a solar array model, such as how long it
takes to effectively change voltage across the solar array.
