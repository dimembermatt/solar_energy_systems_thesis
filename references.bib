    abstract    = {Presently, many equivalent circuit models have been developed and proposed to describe the photovoltaic (PV) cell's characteristics, and the most commonly used are single and double diode models. In a single diode model, a complete characteristic of a PV cell's can be described by five model parameters i.e.: light generated current, leakage or reverse saturation current, diode quality factor, series resistance and shunt resistance. Light generated current and reverse saturation current can be said as external influences meanwhile the others are internal influences. Accuracy of the PV system modelling is depending on the correct calculation of the internal influences. A research preliminary in order to identify internal influences have been performed and will be presented in this paper. As a research subject, polycrystalline silicon (wafer based crystalline silicon technology) and amorphous silicon (thin film technology) modules, as components of grid-connected PV array system at Szent István University (SZIU), were used under Gödöllő climatic conditions. As an initial step, simulation results based on software packages (associated with the PV characteristics) and some calculation methods to identify internal influences are shown here. As a long term outcome of this research, internal parameters of both modules can be predicted, and furthermore PV cell's model for both modules can be developed.}

I-V characteristics of these cells were plotted with measurements done at room temperature, and were modeled using the single diode model. We find that the short circuit current, the photocurrent and the ideality factor increase linearly with the irradiation level intensity while the open circuit voltage and efficiency increase logarithmically. The fill factor increases slightly for low intensities, and then it decreases with higher intensities of irradiation. The saturation current increases exponentially. The series resistance remains invariant and the shunt resistance decreases linearly.}

The long-wavelength tail of SR shifts toward longer wavelengths as the temperature increases. Although the wavelength shift Δλ per temperature difference ΔT is dependent on the device structure and λ, the present results show that the shift in the quantum efficiency (QE), which is related to SR by QE ≈ SR × 1240/λ, can be approximated using the wavelength-independent constant of Δλ/ΔT ∼ 0.45 nm/K for various types of c-Si device. The results indicate that the temperature dependence of SR can be approximated using a simple relation for various types of c-Si PV device, which greatly improves the precision of spectral mismatch correction when SR at only one temperature is available.}
