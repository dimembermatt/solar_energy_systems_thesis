The two diodes of the two-diode model are not able to define the different current components of the solar cells clearly. A model with three-diodes has been proposed to better explain the experimental data. In the proposed model, we considered the series resistance, Rs, of the solar cell to vary with the current flowing through the solar cell device. All the parameters of the proposed model have been estimated using a PSO algorithm and they were compared with the parameters of the two-diode model. The new model has been found to be a better model to define clearly the different current components of the large size industrial silicon solar cells.}

The root mean square error and the mean absolute percentage error are computed to validate the estimation stage. Likewise, the behavior of each parameter of the models is analyzed by calculating their mean and standard deviation. Some places of interest on the I&ndash;V curve, such as the short&ndash;circuit point, the open&ndash;circuit point, and the maximum power point, are also estimated and compared.},

In a single diode model, a complete characteristic of a PV cell's can be described by five model parameters i.e.: light generated current, leakage or reverse saturation current, diode quality factor, series resistance and shunt resistance. Light generated current and reverse saturation current can be said as external influences meanwhile the others are internal influences. Accuracy of the PV system modelling is depending on the correct calculation of the internal influences. A research preliminary in order to identify internal influences have been performed and will be presented in this paper. As a research subject, polycrystalline silicon (wafer based crystalline silicon technology) and amorphous silicon (thin film technology) modules, as components of grid-connected PV array system at Szent István University (SZIU), were used under Gödöllő climatic conditions. As an initial step, simulation results based on software packages (associated with the PV characteristics) and some calculation methods to identify internal influences are shown here. As a long term outcome of this research, internal parameters of both modules can be predicted, and furthermore PV cell's model for both modules can be developed.}

I-V characteristics of these cells were plotted with measurements done at room temperature, and were modeled using the single diode model. We find that the short circuit current, the photocurrent and the ideality factor increase linearly with the irradiation level intensity while the open circuit voltage and efficiency increase logarithmically. The fill factor increases slightly for low intensities, and then it decreases with higher intensities of irradiation. The saturation current increases exponentially. The series resistance remains invariant and the shunt resistance decreases linearly.}

The long-wavelength tail of SR shifts toward longer wavelengths as the temperature increases. Although the wavelength shift Δλ per temperature difference ΔT is dependent on the device structure and λ, the present results show that the shift in the quantum efficiency (QE), which is related to SR by QE ≈ SR × 1240/λ, can be approximated using the wavelength-independent constant of Δλ/ΔT ∼ 0.45 nm/K for various types of c-Si device. The results indicate that the temperature dependence of SR can be approximated using a simple relation for various types of c-Si PV device, which greatly improves the precision of spectral mismatch correction when SR at only one temperature is available.}

To understand the temperature and irradiance impacts on the single-diode parameters, seven polycrystalline silicon solar cells were studied through a careful experimental characterization in the range of 600–1000 W/m2 and 25–55 °C. To extract single-diode parameters, the Differential Evolution optimization technique was employed, resulting in very low fitting errors between experimental and simulated I-V curves. The results obtained showed that the shunt and series resistance were more affected by the increasing temperature, with an exponential decrease, than for increasing irradiance, with a linear increase and decrease for series and shunt resistance, respectively. The diode ideality factor showed no significant changes with increasing temperature and irradiance, while the diode saturation current showed an exponential dependence on increasing temperature, but no significant changes with increasing irradiance. Furthermore, it was seen that even with same nominal features, polycrystalline silicon solar cells may present very different values and behaviors for the single-diode parameters.}
